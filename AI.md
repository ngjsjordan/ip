# AI Use Summary

## A-AiAssisted

Used Github Copilot with GPT-4.1. Asked for a refactoring of the rather messy Parser class. 
The code was improved by abstracting out the Stream parsing of parameters into their own
methods, simplifying the main parse method.

## A-MoreTesting

Same AI assistance used. Asked for more unit tests in ParserTest and TaskListTest. It was
not as good as in the refactoring, but it did speed up the writing of tests as I only had
to troubleshoot and simplify some of the conditions that were being tested.
